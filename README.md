# Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn to identify key factors influencing customer attrition. It includes data loading from Kaggle, data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning model training, interpretation, and reporting.

## Project Structure

- `customer_churn_analysis.py`: Python script containing the entire project code.
- `telco-customer-churn.zip`: Dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
- `churn_prediction_model.pkl`: Serialized machine learning model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Kaggle API
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- joblib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/customer-churn-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the Kaggle dataset:
   - Create a Kaggle account and obtain API credentials.
   - Update `customer_churn_analysis.py` with your Kaggle username and API key.
   - Run the script to download and extract the dataset.

## Usage

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run `python customer_churn_analysis.py` to execute the project.
3. The script will download the dataset, perform data processing, train the machine learning model, and save the model as `churn_prediction_model.pkl`.
4. Check the generated EDA plots and model evaluation metrics in the console output.

## Additional Notes

- Modify the script as needed for custom analysis or model tuning.
- Explore different machine learning algorithms or hyperparameters for improved performance.
